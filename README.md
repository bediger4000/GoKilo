# kilo text editor in Golang

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/bediger4000/GoKilo)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/bediger4000/GoKilo)

I did [Build Your Own Text
Editor](http://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html) only [in Go
instead of C](https://github.com/bediger4000/kilo-in-go).  In my
original effort, I tried to keep the spirit of `kilo`: a single file of
source code, everything as simple as possible.

This project is an attempt to refactor the C-like Go I was left with
after finishing the project. I've created packages to separate concerns,
and made it more idiomatic Go, rather than transliterated C.
